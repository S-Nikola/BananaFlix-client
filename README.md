<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 BananaFlix-React-client <a name="about-project"></a>


**BananaFlix-React-client** is the client side of a movie browsing app, made with React-Bootstrap. It allows users to register, log in and browse through movies. They can add movies to their list of favorites and they can view them and their profile details in the ProfileView, where they can also edit user details. The purpose of the project was to learn React as part of the CareerFoundry curriculum. It is part of a larger full-stack project and one of two clients (the other made with Angular) using the same backend.
